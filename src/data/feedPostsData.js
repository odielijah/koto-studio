        Lyft is a company that needs little by way of introduction. Since the brand launched, 
        Lyft has championed rebelliousness and delight, offering an energetic alternative to 
        the drab universe of rideshare. Just over a decade later, Lyft was eager to reimagine 
        their brand for a new chapter of their business: more mature, and refocused around their newly formed brand strategy.

        In 2024, the world’s leading trip planning platform, Tripadvisor, came to us 
        ready for an overhaul, just in time for its 25th anniversary this year. 
        Tripadvisor began as a way for real people to read authentic reviews and easily 
        find great advice for their next trip. At the time, it was revolutionary — 
        and in this day and age, with generic content and AI-driven suggestions 
        flooding the travel category — it still is.
